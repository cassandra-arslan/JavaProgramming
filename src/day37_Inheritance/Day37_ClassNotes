OOP Inheritance: to build IS A relation between classes (parent and child,  super and sub)

			easiest way to get rich ===> extends

			child class (sub class): can inherite all the variables & methods (visible) from the parent class

			parent class (super class): can not inherit anything from child class. conatin all the common features that are meant to be inherited


		Advantages:
			less codes
			improves the reusability
			clean
			less memory usage
			easy to maintain


		Class A  extends  Class B




this keyword: referst to the instances. Current class
	this. : calls instance variables & instance methods
	this() : calls the constructor of current class


super keyword: referst to the instances. parent class
	super. :calls instance variables & instance methods of super class
	super() : calls the constructor of parent class



	Constructor calls in inheritance:
			1. Child class MUST call parent class' constructor
			2. Parent class' default constructor is always called implicitly in child class
			3. Parent class' constructor with argument need to be called explicitly
