static block: used for initializing static variables
			  gets executed as son as the class is loaded
			  runs first before everything, only runs one time

			  if the static variables need several steps to be initialized



Constructors short quiz due by 11:45 am


static import vs regular import

		regular import: imports everything from the class
			import packageName.className;
			import packageName.*;


		static import:

			import static packageName.className.staticMember;  // imports one static member of a class
			import static packageName.className.*;			 // imports all static members of a class

From julia -

setting up instance variables: use constructor
setting up static variables: use static block

Quiz question #8; it's constructor chaining, you need to figure out which constrcutor is chained to which one and when one constructor gets executed the one that's chained to it will also get executed.


InterviewQuestion:
Can a class be static?
yes, but only if there is a nested class and if the inner class contains the static keyword.

Classes can be nested, we can have outer and inner classes in Java

in Java every single file can only be ONE java class

in order to be static it has to be a member of a class

classes do not have any memory

Static variables - if there is a common value for all the objects

Static Methods - if the method doesnt need instance variables or methods (advantage - uses less memory and you dont need an object you can just call it through the classroom)

Static Blocks - used to initialize static variables, if the variable has several steps, gets executed as soon as class is loaded. Runs first before everything, only runs one time. IIf the static

Static Class- only inner class can be static, once inner class is static it can be called through the outer class

Regular import statement- import packageName.className; imports everything from a class. import packageName.;

Static Import -  first you give the import keyword, and then the second keyword is static so the complire knows the members you want to import are static, 3rd is the packageName, then the class name, static members are placed inside the class
---------------> import static packageName.className.staticMember; // imports ONE static member of a class
 but if you want to import everything you add . at the end like so ->import static packageName.className.*; //imports all the static members of a class .
